exercise 1: The robot typist ---
assumptions:
- 

instructions: 
- determine the number of characters in the message
- determine number of lines needed to hold message (factoring in page width)
- find nearest integer of words that fits within max 60 characters and is even number of characters for a lines
- take x to be number of characters of that message: starting position of each line of text would be
equal to = (60-x)/2
- add condition so that, if message length exceeds last character space of line 25, then put this message at 
beginning of next paper

exercise 2: Remainders ---
assumptions:
- x/y
- denominator (y) is not 0
- x & y are both positive or both negative

instructions:
- is x>y? if yes, continue. else, x/y is the remainder 
- add y to itself 'n' times, until the sum is within one increment of y away from x (until (x-y)<*sum*<=x)
- remainder = x - n*y

exercise 3: Triangle Types ---
assumptions:
- a = side 1, b = side 2, c = side 3
- if two sides are equal (equal sides = x), than the third side must be longer by x*sqrt(2)
- acute traingles can be scalene, equilateral, or isosceles
- right triangles can be scalene or isosceles, but never equilateral
- obtuse triangles can be scalene or isosceles, but never equilateral

instructions:
---quick check to rule out options---
- if a = b = c, traingle is equilateral and acute, else is *not* equilateral

---figure out side-based term---
- if no sides match, triangle is scalene 
- if any of two sides are equal, triangle is isosceles

---figure out angles---
- find two angles A1 & A2 using pythagorean and leave A3 as unknown
- if either A1 or A2 are 90deg, than triangle is right
- if neither are 90 and A1 + A2 < 90deg, than triangle is obtuse
- if neither are 90 and A1 + A2 > 90deg, than triangle is acute

exercise 4: The Radio Show ---
assumptions:
- 

instructions:
- leave space for recording elapsed time, and space for the caller's name. 
- once you play the first track and get the first call, the first person to get both the artist 
and song title correct will get their name written down on the card with the elapsed time it took 
- you continue playing music until someone gives the correct answers in a shorter period of time 
than the quickest one written on the card, at which point you would erase and rerecord the new winners
name and their elapsed time
- continue until your shift is over and you should have the fastest responder written down on the card.

exercise 5: Dot-to-Dot Transmission ---
*assignment note*:
not really sure whether or not this exercise is asking us to send over an image that would give the receiver
an image of just dots, or that they would receive an image of the already completed dot puzzles. 

assumptions:
- scale of image is fixed 
- using a unit circle in degrees
- d = sqrt(x^2+y^2) = distance in px
- sequence order: "current dot number (DN)", "direction towards next DN", "distance towards next DN;"

instructions:
- evaluate the lines that connect one dot from the next, extract the distance from each other, and 
the angle that the lower-valued dot had when 'facing' the next.
- send over code that sequences the values as such: "1_190deg_15px,2_180deg_2px,3_175deg_6px,...,75_210deg_5px

exercise 6: Celebrity Finder ---
assumptions:
- 'known list', constructed and updated by people attending the party, filled with the names of those that are
know at the party by the ones previously asked.

instructions:
- I would start by picking someone at random and ask them whome they knew of the remaining guests
- Then, picking one of the people that the first knew, ask them if they know anyone known by the first person
- repeat the above with each person on the updated 'known list'
- as you ask this question, the list of people to ask should be decreasing, as each person unknown by the current 
person being asked will be removed from the asking list - as they would not be the celebrity. 

how many times will this need to be asked? worst case would be that everyone knows everyone except for one or
two other people, making the filtration of names off the list slower or close to just about asking everyone.
It would be much quicker if those we asked only knew a fraction of the party-goers.

exercise 7: Poker Hands ---
assumptions:
- ranked list with hand type hierarchy pre-written, with nested individual-card-hierarchy list for each hand type 
    - hand types ranked 1-10 (high card - royal flush), cards ranked 1-14 (2-ace)
instructions:
---figure out hand comparisons---
- scan hand1 (h1) and determine hand type, then do hand2 (h2)
- hand values are produced by converting their hand-types and the respective individual cards of each type from
their place on the list into 2 separate numeric values
- compare the hand-type value 
- if one is greater than the other, the greater value player wins
- else, we check the card rank - or in other words, the different combinations of the hand-types possible
and the greater value player wins
