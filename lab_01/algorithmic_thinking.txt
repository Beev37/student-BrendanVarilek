exercise 1: The robot typist ---
assumptions:
- knows length of message (number of characters and lines)

instructions: 
- determine the number of characters in the message
- determine number of lines needed to hold message (factoring in page width)
- find nearest integer of words that fits within max 60 characters and is even number of characters for a lines
- take x to be number of characters of that message: starting position of each line of text would be

- add condition so that, if message length exceeds last character space of line 25, then put this message at 
beginning of next paper

exercise 2: Remainders ---
assumptions:
- denominator is not 0
-
